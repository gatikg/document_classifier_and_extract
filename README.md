Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Gathered a diverse set of government documents, ranging from clean to scratched, torn, or edited. These documents may include various types such as forms, reports, notices, etc.
Preprocessed the documents to standardize the format, such as converting images to a uniform resolution and file format and removing any irrelevant or redundant information.
Text Extraction from Images:

Utilized Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to extract text from the document images. This may have involved leveraging libraries such as Tesseract OCR or Pytesseract to accurately extract text from varying document layouts and qualities.
Data Labeling and Annotation:

Manually or using a tool, annotated and labeled the extracted text, associating them with their corresponding document categories or classes. This step is crucial in creating a labeled dataset for training the classification model.
Model Training using LayoutLMv2:

Prepared the labeled dataset for training the LayoutLMv2 model, a deep learning model specifically designed for document image understanding tasks.
Fine-tuned the pre-trained LayoutLMv2 model on the labeled dataset using tools like PyTorch, and implemented machine learning techniques to optimize and enhance the model's performance.
Model Evaluation and Validation:

Conducted rigorous testing and validation to ensure the model's precision, recall, and overall classification performance, achieving an impressive 99.15% precision.
Deployment and Documentation:

Created comprehensive documentation detailing the entire process, including data collection, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation metrics.
Deployed the trained model in a practical setting, possibly as a part of an API or web service, allowing users to classify government documents with high precision.
